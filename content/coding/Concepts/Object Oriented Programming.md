##### Objects Oriented Programming


Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a **style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with** which they are associated.
It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.

There are four fundamental OOPs concepts â€“

1. Inheritance
2. Encapsulation
3. [[Polymorphism]]
4. Data Abstraction


An example of [[Polymorphism]] is [[The Clean Architecture]]
